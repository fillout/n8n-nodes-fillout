# n8n trigger for Fillout submissions

This is an n8n community node that lets you trigger n8n workflows when your Fillout form receives a new submission.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) on the n8n documentation website.

## Usage

Add the trigger in n8n, and when creating a credential, you'll need to get an API key from your [account settings](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/developer) in Fillout. Make sure that the correct base URL is set, as you can have submissions hosted in different regions with [Fillout Enterprise](https://www.fillout.com/enterprise).

## Developers

For instructions on testing this node on a local n8n instance for development purposes, see https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/test/run-node-locally/
